        <h2>Data</h2>
        <p>The ten leading causes of death are shown above, with the number of deaths per each category shown by year, starting from 1999 and ending with 2016. 
          This data was published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and can be accessed here: 
          <a href='https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/age-adjusted-death-rates-for-the-top-10-leading-causes-of-death-united-states-2013'>https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/age-adjusted-death-rates-for-the-top-10-leading-causes-of-death-united-states-2013</a>. 
          Information was gathered based on the resident death certificates in the 
          respective 50 states as well as Washington DC. The above graphs show the number of deaths per each of the ten leading causes of death. These are straight
          numbers and are not adjusted per state, so data across states should only be compared taking this into consideration. 
        </p>
        <h2>Discussion</h2>
        <p>While all ten leading causes of death are displayed, it is easily seen that there is a wide margin between the top two causes and the remaining causes.
          These top two causes are heart disease and cancer. Looking at the congregate data from all locations, it would be easy to assume that overall, the number
          of deaths due to heart disease have decreased while those due to cancer have increased in the past 17 years. However, this trend cannot be seen across all 
          individual locations. For example, in Colorado, the number of deaths due to heart disease have increased, from 6.4 thousand in 1999 to 7.3 thousand in 2016.
          This contrasts Iowa, which following the overall trend, had 8.7 thousand heart disease deaths in 1999 compared to only 6.9 thousand deaths in 2016. Without also 
          having information on the overall population in both places as well as overall number of deaths, it is difficult to draw conclusions from just this. However, it
          may lead one to wonder if treatment between different locations is significant and if advances, technology, and experience are evenly spread. 
        </p>
        <p>Putting aside the top two leading causes, one cause which only barely made the top ten may actually hold more reason for concern. Recently, the topic of mental 
          health has been taking an increasing position of importance in media. Viewing this data, suicide has the fewest overall number of deaths; however, unlike many of the 
          other causes of death, death due to suicide has been slowly but steadily increasing over the past years. This shows that more attention should be given to this cause of 
          death, so this increase may be stunted or halted. 
        </p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Overall, this data is insufficient for drawing clear-cut conclusions about the leading causes of death and the current state of treatment for these causes. However,
          it brings to light questions about treament of these various causes throughout the different states. It also enforces the growing concerns about mental health, by showing
          a trend of suicide increasing in recent years. This data, therefore, presents a good motivation for futher research into these aspects. More specific and detailed data should
          be gathered on the treatments of leading causes of death. If death due to one cause is decreasing in a certain state due to advanced treatment, this information or technology
          should be encouraged to spread to other states as well. With regard to the increased rate of suicide, research should be done into those more likely to commit suicide (perhaps
          a certain age group, or of a certain socioeconomic class), and targeted support should be given to those in need.
